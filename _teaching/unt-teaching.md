I had my first teaching experience at Universidad Nacional de Tucumán while studying for my Bachelor's.
I taught two different courses, one core course and an elective course for Economics. The two courses were taught in Spanish.

**Bachelor level**


* Economic Problems of Latin America, 2015-2017.
* Mathematical Analysis, 2013-2014.
